So this covers :
- Bug Catching Contest (BCC) with and without cute charm
- Safari Zone with and without cute charm
- Headbutt

You'll need :
- Desmume
- Lua Scripts
- RNG Reporter

Ofc you have to know how to do Wild RNG without any problem.

Bug Catching Contest :

Encounter Slots are restricted to 10. So you'll have to search between 0 and 9 for Encounter Slots. You can follow Serebii's pokearth data, it matches without any problem.
Save in front of the guy the right day so you'll have to anticipate the fact you'll have to walk TO a grass patch.

1) If you have cute charm, just open the 4gen Time Finder, select the Bug Catching Contest in Encounter Type and search for ANY frame. 
2) If you don't have cute charm, select your lead (any or sync) but you'll have to know that ANY frame which a total IVs of less than 100 will be skipped to the occidentary. So you'll NEVER be able to hit some frames without cute charm lead. To avoid that, you need to find HIGH ivs frames and go for one.




Safari Zone :

Encounter Slots are restricted to 10 AND are influenced by items / days. You can follow Serebii's Pokearth to know which conditions you need and what you can find.
BUT. Encounter Slots are not always the same. So you'll have to figure YOURSELF which encounter slot = which pokemon. 
For that, after saving in front of the guy which allows you to enter, you just need to enter in the safari with any given initial seed, going to the main tab of RNG Reporter (Method K => Encounter Type : Safari Zone w/ the initial seed) and create your own encounter table by checking the slots. Once you have the slot of your target you can search for a Target frame

1) If you have cute charm, it's the same as BCC, and you can go on ANY given frame.
2) If you don't have cute charm, it's the same as BCC, you'll need to find GOOD (> 100 Ivs total) IVs frames.



Headbutt : 

Encounter slots are not really known at all. You can follow serebii ONLY to have an idea of species present in the tree. Every tree seems to change of encounter slots every day. Same for special trees (like Combee or Slakoth in the north of Cerulean).
After saving in front of the tree, reload your stuff with any initial seed. Use the main windows of RNG reporter (MEthod K => Encounter Type : Headbutt tree w/ initial seed) and creating your own encounter table. Once you've checked that, you can search for a target frame.
Unlike BCC or Safari Zone, no restriction on the lead, it's really like a regular wild.
But the main thing is that you need to substract -1 from your target frame in order to hit it. For example, if your target frame is 130, you'll have to up your PIDRNGFrame to 129 and use headbutt.

/!\ rough draft again /!\
You can copy on my FRLG guide for 90% of the part. This guide is BEFORE the update with Real's scripts

This guide is to cover Fixed Initial Seed in Gen 3 aka RS dry and Emerald.

You need :

- vba Lua scripts (noob or project pokemon one) 
- PokeFinder

Open PokeFinder with the right profile and put the initial seed :

    0 for Emerald
    5A0 for Ruby / Sapphire dry.

Note : to have a dry ruby / sapphire just uncheck the real time clock in vba options.

Find a target : Every Gift / Stationary is under this category.

With PokeFinder (Gen 3 => Stationary), In all case, you'll hit Method 1 Pokemon.

Launch vba, do REGULAR save states. Once close to your frame do a calibration :

save state => note the frame you're on => Start the battle / Accept the Pokemon => search that spread with pokefinder => do the math to find the delay and enter it in "delay box" => regenerate your target to have your new frame.

Once done go to your target frame; you'll hit what you want.

If not, just redo the calibration.

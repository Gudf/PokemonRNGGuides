## Hitting the Desired Frame
---

1 Finding Delay

- Advance to the final screen before encountering the target Pokemon.
- Make a save state ~100 frames before the encouter.

- When you land on your target frame press `A` and enter the encounter.
  - The Period key can be used to advance by one frame when paused.
- Take note of the IVs of the Pokemon you encounterd, they won't be the target pokemon's IVs. We will need to find a new Target Frame to get the correct Pokemon.

![](Pic of ivs)

- Open a new PokeFinder window and input IVs of the Pokemon encountered.
- To find the dely subtract the Hit Frame - Desired Frame.
- Your new Target Target Frame = Desired Frame - Delay

2. Encountering the Pokemon

- Reload the previous save state before the encounter.
- Advance to the new Target Frame.
 - If the pokemon is not the desired pokemon then find the new delay

Necessary :
- Desmume (any version even if 9.11 is more stable)
- Lua Scripts (Noob forums is the best for that here)
- PokeFinder
Before, you must know how to hit an initial seed. You can check the right guide for that
So first, find your target. Save in front of the Pokemon OR the NPC
Open PokeFinder : Gen 4 => Stationary. Go on Searcher tab (important /!\) select or create your profile. After enter the wanted parameters.
/!\ Unlike the Gen 3, not EVERY Pokemon is method 1. here's a list of Method 1 Pokemon in DPPt /!\ : 
   Starters
   Fossils
   Riolu's egg
   Eevee from Bebe
   Roamers
   
Exclusive to Platinum :
   Togepi Egg
   Porygon
/!\  The delay can be high same with the frames /!\
Once you have a target frame, right click on it and "Generate times for seed"
Open your emulator and load your lua script. Hit the initial seed.
Open your menu with X. From that you've some ways to advance PIDRNG Frames. It's better to do a save state here :
- Chatot (x2 prefered) with chatter activated. If it's not working just use the record of desmume to get it working, it'll advance frames.
- NPC (advance them random)
- Journal (advance by 2 if you have a "[pokemon] was caught!" every time you flip pages)
Once on the right frame, just launch the battle / talk to the NPC.
If you're in a place with NPC (aka advancing NPC by theirself) try to press A as fast as possible. If not, just reload the state done before to adjust and anticipate this advancement. If a NPC advances the frame by 2, just do target frame - 2
